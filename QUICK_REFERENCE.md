# Quick Reference - Orders Table Update

## 🎯 Quick Summary

**Fixed**: Missing `completed_at` column error  
**Added**: Auto-timestamp tracking for order completion & cancellation  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for deployment

---

## 📋 New Columns

| Column | Type | Auto-Filled? | When? |
|--------|------|--------------|-------|
| `completed_at` | TIMESTAMP | ✅ Yes | When `status` → `'completed'` |
| `cancelled_at` | TIMESTAMP | ✅ Yes | When `status` → `'cancelled'` |

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### Automatic Behavior

```sql
-- Update order status to completed
UPDATE orders SET status = 'completed' WHERE id = 'xxx';
-- ✨ completed_at is automatically set to NOW()

-- Update order status to cancelled  
UPDATE orders SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE id = 'xxx';
-- ✨ cancelled_at is automatically set to NOW()

-- Revert status back to processing
UPDATE orders SET status = 'processing' WHERE id = 'xxx';
-- ✨ completed_at and cancelled_at automatically cleared
```

### Manual Override (if needed)

```sql
-- You can still set manually if needed
UPDATE orders 
SET status = 'completed', 
    completed_at = '2025-10-25 10:00:00+00'
WHERE id = 'xxx';
```

## 💻 Code Examples

### PostgreSQL

```sql
-- Get all completed orders with completion date
SELECT 
    order_number,
    status,
    created_at,
    completed_at,
    (completed_at - created_at) AS completion_time
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'completed'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;

-- Get orders completed today
SELECT * 
FROM orders
WHERE DATE(completed_at) = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Get average completion time
SELECT 
    AVG(completed_at - created_at) AS avg_time
FROM orders
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;
```

### JavaScript / TypeScript

```typescript
// Supabase query
const { data: completedOrders } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*')
  .eq('status', 'completed')
  .not('completed_at', 'is', null)
  .order('completed_at', { ascending: false });

// Calculate completion time
const completionTime = new Date(order.completed_at) - new Date(order.created_at);
const hours = completionTime / (1000 * 60 * 60);

// Get orders completed in last 7 days
const { data: recentOrders } = await supabase
  .from('orders')
  .select('*')
  .gte('completed_at', new Date(Date.now() - 7*24*60*60*1000).toISOString())
  .order('completed_at', { ascending: false });
```

### Python

```python
# Supabase query
response = supabase.table('orders') \
    .select('*') \
    .eq('status', 'completed') \
    .not_.is_('completed_at', 'null') \
    .order('completed_at', desc=True) \
    .execute()

# Calculate completion time
from datetime import datetime
created = datetime.fromisoformat(order['created_at'])
completed = datetime.fromisoformat(order['completed_at'])
completion_time = completed - created
```

## 🎨 Frontend Display Examples

### React Component

```tsx
function OrderCard({ order }) {
  const getCompletionTime = () => {
    if (!order.completed_at) return null;
    const start = new Date(order.created_at);
    const end = new Date(order.completed_at);
    const hours = Math.floor((end - start) / (1000 * 60 * 60));
    return `Selesai dalam ${hours} jam`;
  };

  return (
    <div className="order-card">
      <h3>{order.order_number}</h3>
      <p>Status: {order.status}</p>
      {order.completed_at && (
        <p>
          Selesai: {new Date(order.completed_at).toLocaleDateString('id-ID')}
          <br />
          {getCompletionTime()}
        </p>
      )}
      {order.cancelled_at && (
        <p>Dibatalkan: {new Date(order.cancelled_at).toLocaleDateString('id-ID')}</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 📊 Useful Queries

### Orders completed in last 30 days
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE completed_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;
```

### Orders cancelled before completion
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE cancelled_at IS NOT NULL
  AND completed_at IS NULL
ORDER BY cancelled_at DESC;
```

### Fast vs slow orders (completion time)
```sql
SELECT 
    order_number,
    status,
    (completed_at - created_at) AS duration,
    CASE 
        WHEN (completed_at - created_at) < INTERVAL '24 hours' THEN 'Fast'
        WHEN (completed_at - created_at) < INTERVAL '72 hours' THEN 'Normal'
        ELSE 'Slow'
    END AS speed
FROM orders
WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY duration;
```

### Completion rate by service
```sql
SELECT 
    s.name AS service_name,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(o.completed_at) AS completed_orders,
    ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(o.completed_at) / COUNT(*), 2) AS completion_rate
FROM orders o
JOIN services s ON o.service_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.name
ORDER BY completion_rate DESC;
```

## ⚡ Performance Tips

### Use Indexes
The new indexes are automatically created:
- `idx_orders_completed_at`
- `idx_orders_cancelled_at`

These make date-based queries very fast!

### Efficient Queries
```sql
-- ✅ GOOD - Uses index
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE completed_at > '2025-10-01'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC;

-- ❌ AVOID - Doesn't use index efficiently
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE DATE(completed_at) = '2025-10-01';

-- ✅ BETTER - Use range for dates
SELECT * FROM orders 
WHERE completed_at >= '2025-10-01' 
  AND completed_at < '2025-10-02';
```

## 🆘 Common Issues

### Issue: "Column already exists"
**Solution**: Normal! The migration script handles this automatically.

### Issue: "Trigger already exists"
**Solution**: Script will DROP and recreate. This is expected.

### Issue: Old orders don't have timestamps
**Solution**: Migration script automatically backfills from `updated_at`.

### Issue: Need to query old format
**Solution**: Both old and new ways work:
```sql
-- Old way (still works)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'completed';

-- New way (more precise)
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL;
```
